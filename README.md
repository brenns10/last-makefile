# The Last Makefile You'll Ever Need

Well, it's at least the last Makefile I'll ever need.  This makefile is designed
for any general purpose C project.  I'm putting it into the public domain --
just copy and paste right into your project, fill out the configuration
variables, and start making in style!

Check the makefile for instructions for use.
